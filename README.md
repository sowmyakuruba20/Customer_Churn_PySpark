# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
![screenshot](churn.png)
## Project Overview
The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company) based on various features related to customer demographics, services subscribed, and account information. This project uses a dataset containing information about customers and their interactions with telecom services.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 21 features, which include customer demographics, service details, and account information.

## Project Steps
1. Loading the Data

* Install necessary libraries.
* Import modules.
* Build Spark session.
* Load the dataset.
* Print the data schema and dimensions.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Perform distribution analysis.
* Conduct correlation analysis.
* Carry out univariate analysis.
* Identify missing values.
* Analyze numerical features using histograms.
* Generate a correlation matrix.
* Check unique value counts for categorical variables.
* Find the number of null values in the dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values using an Imputer.
* Remove outliers, particularly in the tenure column.

4. Feature Preparation

* Prepare numerical features:
  - Assemble feature vectors.
  - Scale numerical features.
* Prepare categorical features:
  - Index categorical features.
  - Assemble feature vectors.
* Combine numerical and categorical feature vectors.

5. Modeling and Evaluation

* Split the data into training and test sets.
* Train machine learning models.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
* Fine-tune models to improve performance.
